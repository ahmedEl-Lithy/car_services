# car_services
This project was made as a faculty project during 2013/2014.

This project was meant to serve as a reservation system, the user (customer) before going to the shop to fix his car, 
he first reserve an appointment in a specific day and select what kind of service he wishes to be done to his car.
The user could also cancel his appointment or reschedule it.
The user could enter his payment details to pay online if he prefers or pay in cash.

The Admin could add Services that his shop provides, check his schedule and what appointments he/she has today.

In this project i followed the PHP MVC paradigm.
For the database connection i used PDO with mysql

I realised that mysql became deprecated in PHP 5+ and then got removed since PHP 7
i am willing to alter the connections in the future as i am busy meanwhile
